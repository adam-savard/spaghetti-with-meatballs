# spaghetti-with-meatballs
A way to parse through a whole bunch of spaghetti code to hopefully make some sense out of it.

So far, there are basic GUI elements, such as a Setup Wizard to get the very basics up and running (Author and Project), and an extremely basic UI for functions like creating a new Author, etc.

The next steps for this project involve showing a call stack (a more complicated process, as drill-down is easy, but drill-up is not), file scanning for automation, and a MAJOR rework of the current GUI.
